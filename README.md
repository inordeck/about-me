# About Me

## Before GA:
for the past 16 years i have been working as a designer, art director and creastive director at multiple agencies in and around denver and as an independent contractor. my last position was as the senior art director at d&i creative. before art school i served four years active duty in the marine corps. 

## Outcomes support I need:
networking events - i don't like going and feel uncomfortable making introductions

interviewing - i'm comfortable with most of the interview aspects but i am concerned about having to solve code problems (hoping that is not an issue by the end) and lack confidence when it comes to salary negotiations.

## Day 1 Goals:
1. stop designing and start building

## Two Truths and a Lie
1. i have completed a police s.w.a.t. school.
2. i have done a pilgramage to borobudur, the largest buddhist temple in the world, located on the island of java in indonesia.
3. i have been married for almost 24 years.

## Meetups I've attended:


## What type of company would you like to work for (i.e. Agency, Product, Startup)?
after 16 years of working in design and advertising, i'm pretty burnt out on the agency model. one of the things i was looking for before i made the decision to go to general assembly for the web development immersive course was to find an in-house position. i had the opportunity to contract with a couple of in-house marketing teams and enjoyed the focused work over the turn and burn aspect of agency life. i also like smaller companies over larger. i like to be involved in developing and improving processes and that can be near impossible to accomplish at large companies. location wise i am open to working in denver, but i live down south and would definitely consider a company in the denver tech center or other south suburban locations.

## What kind of role are you leaning towards (i.e. Frontend, Backend, etc)?
based on my background, frontend seems like the obvious choice, but i also don't want to get stuck in a design position since i'm trying to transition out of design into a developer role. (i'm really tired of designing websites to put into a powerpoint presentation for someone else to figure out how to build it.) right now i'm leaning on the idea of doing both because i'm fascinated by how the backend works and i understand how to make the front end look good.
